# homog2d

Current test status: [![GH actions build status](https://github.com/skramm/homog2d/actions/workflows/c-cpp.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/skramm/homog2d/actions)

![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/skramm/homog2d)

A single-file header-only C++ library dedicated to
handling 2D lines, points and homographies (2D planar transformations),
using internally [homogeneous coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinates).
Also handles other geometric primitives, see full manual.

- Language: C++14
- Home: https://github.com/skramm/homog2d
- Usage: just fetch the file `homog2d.hpp`, put it somewhere, and "#include" it in your source file. No build!
- Status: beta

- Licence: [MPLv2](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/)


Short preview:

```C++
#include "homog2d.hpp"
using namespace h2d;
int main()
{
	Line2d l1( Point2d(10,10) );               // a line passing through (0,0) and (10,10)
	Line2d l2( Point2d(0,10), Point2d(10,0) ); // a line passing through (0,10) and (10,0)
	auto pt = l1 * l2;                         // intersection point (5,5)
	Homogr H(2,3);                             // a translation matrix
	std::cout << H * pt;                       // prints [7,8]
}
```

(see [history](docs/homog2d_history.md) for more)

### Details ##

- Install: to install on your machine, copy file `homog2d.hpp` somewhere where your compiler can reach it, or `$ sudo make install` after cloning repo.
This will copy that file in `/usr/local/include`.

- Audience: any C++ dev requiring some basic computational geometry, without the burden of large scale framework.

- Usage: see [full manual](docs/homog2d_manual.md)

- Reference: once downloaded, enter `$ make doc` (requires Doxygen).

- A test file is provided, needs [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2).
When installed, run `$ make test` (or `$ make testall` for testing with all 3 numerical types).

- **Contributing**: at present, the best you can do is testing and bug/issue reporting.
Don't hesitate, this is still beta but stable release expected soon.

- Rationale:
  - Usage simplicity, max flexibility
  - No dependency [(*)](#rm_fn)
  - Modern C++, using policy-based design, tag dispatching, sfinae, ...
  - Direct bindings with [OpenCv](https://opencv.org/) (optional)

- Geometric features:
  - basic primitives: points, lines, segments, circles, rectangles, polygons, ellipse,
  - planar transformation of any of these (rotation, translation, ...),
  - computing of intersection points between these,
  - easy binding with other libs,
  - ...

- Related libraries:
  - [CGAL](https://www.cgal.org/) the reference computational geometry library.
  - [Opencv](https://docs.opencv.org/) the reference CV library, much more algorithms, but no direct support for homogeneous geometry.
  - [Wykobi](http://www.wykobi.com/), has much more computational geometry features but no direct support for homogeneous geometry.

**Warning**: The images shown in the manual are there just there as an illustration of what the library does, but there is **no rendering code** included.
The library provides drawing function whose implementation requires external code.
The images are drawn either as Svg files, or using a third-party library (Opencv), but the latter is not needed to use this library.
