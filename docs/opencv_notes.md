# Opencv binding problems

[Manual main page](homog2d_manual.md)

__Please read this if you have Opencv installed on your system, but fail to build the Opencv binding demo.__


The [Opencv](https://opencv.org/releases/) binding capabilities for this library are demonstrated with a short graphical demo, included here.
Building the app using the provided Makefile (`$ make demo`) relies on the [`pkg-config`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pkg-config) utility.

Recently, with Opencv4 (and probably also with latest 3.x releases), the Opencv team seems to have dropped support of pkg-config
(see https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/13154).

The demo program has been tested using Opencv 3.4, build from source.
The trick is to activate the pkg-config option when building Opencv with Cmake.
I used:
```
cmake .. -DOPENCV_GENERATE_PKGCONFIG=ON -DWITH_FFMPEG=ON
make
sudo make install
```
However, while this indeed generates the `opencv.pc` file (at least with Opencv3.4), it does not install it on your system.
Thus the makefile for target `demo` fails.
You need to copy it from the opencv build folder to the pkg-config usual location.
From the OpenCv 'build' folder, something like this should be sufficient:
```
$ sudo cp unix-install/opencv.pc /usr/share/pkgconfig/
```

FWIW, in case it does not get generated with your Opencv release, here is the content of that file for release 3.4.14.
Name it `opencv.pc` and copy it to `/usr/share/pkgconfig/`.

```
